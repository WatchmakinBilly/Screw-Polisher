How to: 

I had mine machined by PCBway, just upload the .step and the .png drawing file . make all the same selections as in the "machining instructions image) You could use any cnc serrvice you wish.

Seperate front section of the blank by sawing through the tabs holding it to the main body of the too (I used a hack saw).

File away tabs.

Polish the faces of the tool that had the tabs on them on a peice of glass to ensure flatness.

Reem the holes of the front threaded portion out with a 6mm reemer.

Cut 2 equal length sections of the all-thread rod, file each end flat, then attach the brass thumb screw to the end with locktite. 

Assemble the tool as shown.

Polish the ends of the 2 standoff screws by extending them from the base of the tool by 1mm, inserting something into the vise jaws so that it also protrudes 1mm, and polishing as normal.

remove object from vice jaws , unscrew standoff screw, and tighten vise jaws . then polish the bottom of the tool flat.

Use a square needle file to file in notches for screw and etc that you wish to polish, i recommend puutin the first notch exaclt in the center of the body of the tool (see photo).
